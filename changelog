## Added
* New medium sized electricity pylons
  * Come in wood and steel flavor
  * The regular ones don't connect to cable blocks, the variants with transformers do (i.e. they act like substations for huge pylons)

## Changed
* Condensers now need cast plates instead of welded plates
* Tweaked the substation recipe, it now yields two substations
